# SSL Certificate Fix Applied

## Issue
FileMaker server SSL certificate verification was failing with error:
"unable to verify the first certificate"

## Solution Applied
Added SSL certificate bypass for internal FileMaker servers:

```javascript
import https from 'https';

// Create an agent that accepts self-signed certificates
const httpsAgent = new https.Agent({
  rejectUnauthorized: false
});
```

## Security Note
This bypasses SSL certificate verification for the FileMaker connection. This is acceptable for:
- Internal corporate FileMaker servers
- Self-signed certificates
- Development environments

For production deployments with proper SSL certificates, this can be removed.

## Next Steps
1. Restart Claude Desktop to load the updated MCP server
2. Test connection to TC-AI database
3. Begin discovery phase analysis
