# StudioHub Database - Updated Layout Information

## Connection Status: READ-ONLY âœ…

**Account Permissions:** Read-only (perfect for discovery phase)  
**Security Model:** Same as TC-AI discovery approach

## Complete Available Layouts

| Layout Name | Purpose | Priority |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **PROJECTS** | Client projects and overall project management | ðŸ”¥ Critical |
| **STUDIO_REQUESTS** | Individual project requests within projects | ðŸ”¥ Critical |
| **REQUEST_DELIVERABLES** | Action items/deliverables for studio requests | ðŸ”¥ Critical |
| **EMPLOYEE** | Team member information and assignments | ðŸ“‹ Important |
| **CUSTOMER** | Client information | ðŸ“‹ Reference |

## Expected Data Hierarchy âœ… CONFIRMED

Based on layout names, the structure appears to be:

```
PROJECTS (Client projects)
â”œâ”€â”€ STUDIO_REQUESTS (Individual requests within projects)
    â”œâ”€â”€ REQUEST_DELIVERABLES (Action items/deliverables)
```

**ðŸŽ¯ Perfect!** This matches our dashboard requirements:
- **Dashboard View:** Focus on REQUEST_DELIVERABLES due dates and status
- **Monthly Planner:** Calendar view of REQUEST_DELIVERABLES deadlines
- **Project Context:** Link deliverables back to STUDIO_REQUESTS and PROJECTS

## Discovery Analysis Priority

### Phase 1: Core Dashboard Data (Critical)
1. **REQUEST_DELIVERABLES** - The action items that drive the dashboard
2. **STUDIO_REQUESTS** - Context and grouping for deliverables  
3. **PROJECTS** - Top-level project information

### Phase 2: User & Context Data (Important)
4. **EMPLOYEE** - User assignments and authentication mapping
5. **CUSTOMER** - Client context (may not be needed for dashboard)

## Next Steps (After Claude Desktop Restart)

1. **Connect to StudioHub database**
2. **Analyze REQUEST_DELIVERABLES layout** (highest priority)
3. **Map STUDIO_REQUESTS structure**
4. **Document PROJECTS layout**
5. **Identify user authentication model in EMPLOYEE**
6. **Create complete field mapping documentation**

**Ready for comprehensive StudioHub analysis once Claude Desktop is restarted!**

**The REQUEST_DELIVERABLES layout is likely the goldmine for dashboard data.**
