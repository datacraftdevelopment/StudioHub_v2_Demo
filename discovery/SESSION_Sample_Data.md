## Field Testing Checklist

### Test these field types:
- ✅ **userID** (text) - Various user accounts
- ✅ **conversationHistory** (text) - JSON array format
- ✅ **sessionStatus** (text) - "active", "completed", "paused"
- ✅ **aiProvider** (text) - "OpenAI", "Anthropic"  
- ✅ **chatType** (text) - "project", "chart", "help", "general"
- ✅ **lastMessageTimestamp** (timestamp) - Recent timestamps

### Validation Tests:
1. **JSON Format** - Does conversationHistory store valid JSON?
2. **Text Length** - Can conversationHistory handle long conversations?
3. **Timestamp Format** - Does lastMessageTimestamp accept various formats?
4. **User Association** - Does userID properly link to accounts?

## Expected Results

After adding sample data, the API should return:
```json
{
  "fieldData": {
    "userID": "joe.dasilva",
    "conversationHistory": "[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"What projects...\"}]",
    "sessionStatus": "active",
    "aiProvider": "OpenAI",
    "chatType": "project",
    "lastMessageTimestamp": "07/21/2025 15:30:00"
  }
}
```

## Web Integration Testing

Once sample data is added, we can test:
1. **Session Retrieval** - Find records by userID
2. **Conversation Loading** - Parse JSON conversation history
3. **Session Management** - Filter by sessionStatus
4. **AI Context** - Use chatType for different AI behaviors

**Add one or more sample records, then we can retrieve them via the API to verify the field structure works correctly for web integration!**
