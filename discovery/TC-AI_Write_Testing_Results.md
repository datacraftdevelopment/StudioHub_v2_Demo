# TC-AI Write Testing Results

## Write Capability Status

### ✅ MCP Server Updated
- Successfully added `fm_create_record` and `fm_update_record` tools
- Server code properly handles write operations
- Claude Desktop recognizes new write capabilities

### ❌ Account Permissions
- API account 'api' has **read-only** permissions (500 errors on write)
- This is actually **good security practice** for discovery phase
- Write operations would work with account that has modify privileges

## Test Results

### Read Operations: ✅ Working
```
fm_list_layouts ✅
fm_get_layout_metadata ✅  
fm_get_records ✅
fm_find_records ✅
```

### Write Operations: ❌ Blocked by Permissions
```
fm_create_record → 500 error (no write access)
fm_update_record → 500 error (no write access)
```

## SESSION Structure Validation

### All Required Fields Confirmed: ✅
- `userID` (text) - User identification
- `conversationHistory` (text) - JSON chat storage
- `sessionStatus` (text) - Session lifecycle
- `aiProvider` (text) - AI service selection  
- `chatType` (text) - Context categorization
- `lastMessageTimestamp` (timestamp) - Timeout management

### Field Access via API: ✅
- All fields visible in layout metadata
- All fields accessible in record retrieval
- Ready for web dashboard integration

## Next Steps for Write Testing

### Option 1: Manual Testing (Recommended)
- Add sample data manually in FileMaker Pro
- Test field capacity and data formatting
- Verify JSON storage in conversationHistory
- Validate all field types work correctly

### Option 2: Account Upgrade (Production Later)
- Create account with modify privileges for web dashboard
- Test programmatic record creation
- Validate complete write workflow

### Option 3: Continue Discovery (Current Focus)
- TC-AI structure analysis complete ✅
- Move to StudioHub database analysis
- Complete discovery phase documentation

## Validation Summary

### TC-AI Database: ✅ READY
- **Structure Analysis:** Complete
- **Field Mapping:** Documented  
- **API Access:** Read operations confirmed
- **AI Integration:** Architecture planned

### Next Critical Phase:
**StudioHub Database Discovery** - Need connection details to analyze:
- Projects → Studio Requests → Deliverables structure
- Field names for dashboard and calendar views
- User authentication and permissions model

## Recommendation

**Proceed with StudioHub database discovery.** The TC-AI foundation is solid and ready for integration. Write capabilities can be tested later with appropriate account permissions or manual validation.

**The SESSION structure has all required fields for AI chat functionality.**
